    "### *A Dying Breed?*\n",
    "In broad terms, console gaming has a cultural standing that is hard to replace; for gamers and non-gamers alike, the very mention of a video game brings to mind images of an Xbox controller, a GameBoy, or a Wii remote. Certainly, many of the same people are aware of mobile games, PC games, and games played in wildly different virtual-reality environments. However, the iconography of certain consoles, or of certain console games and franchises, is undeniable. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, there's much speculation that consoles are headed towards an inevitable replacement by both the aforementioned 'modern' gaming platforms and other, unexplored systems. Below, we've provided two reports on the matter. The first (from a technology-oriented site) highlights a recent inability of console launches to boost struggling game sales. Citing that older consoles are seeing declines in overall purchases, it argues that console-exclusive games can be user-hostile, requiring expensive set-ups and constant updates to remain functional. Conversely, the second source (a financial report) argues that based on console games' current market domination, the console industry may see its biggest boost ever within the next five years. \n",

    "    - https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/gaming-console-market \n",
    "   \n",
    "### *Why should you care - and what can you learn - about this issue?*\n",
    "Clearly, this is a multi-faceted issue in need of clear-cut further analysis. And not just video-gamers are affected by this topic! Many life-changing innovations are dervied from gaming equipment and theory. For instance, the Xbox Kinect can be used to develop concussion analysis and treatment options. But at the same time, modern VR technology is becoming increasingly used in military __and__ medical training, a trend that traditional consoles have little place in. The respective summaries for these advances are below.   \n",

    "    - https://science.howstuffworks.com/gamer-soldier2.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "So, where to put our time and resources? In familiar consoles or risky, cutting-edge, non-traditional equpiment? This debate will have seismic impacts. Many markets depend on video games' innovative hardware and software tools: tools that further our ability to visualize, compute, and store information. \n",
    "\n",
    "You, on the other hand, may simply be an avid gamer that is concerned about new consoles' desperate prioritization of online play over local play. Or perhaps you're considering getting into niche PC games, or are curious about the viability of popular smartphone games. \n",
    "\n",
    "### *Why take the data approach?*\n",
    "Of course, we want to form informed stances on the matter, whether our interest in video games is in pursuit of entertainment, innovation, or progress. Doing this small data-oriented exploration will, at the least, help you and others get your foot in the data-science door. If *your* perspective as a user or creator had any weight on the matter, you'd likely want to reason with confidence about the fate of the industry! It's that very confidence that this tutorial will give you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equally relevantly, video game companies use data in a marketing sense, too - it's far from a new practice. Using data analytics and foresight is huge in many modern businesses (such as stocks or social media). So it makes sense that companies have begun processing big data regarding sales, ratings, and popular use of their products. See these links, from data-science and video-game blogs, respectively, for examples:\n",

    "    \n",
    "Consider this, from the Reality Games link: video game corporations are just now figuring out that an approximate half of their base are female players, by logging account usage on consoles and PCs. Only now are they beginning to represent and cater to those players. Imagine how else we could improve their business model, even outside of this project. By documenting who's logging in, what they're drawn to, how they play, and more, an *even broader* and more inclusive gaming commmunity can be made. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Our* goals are to identify the 'what' - which games and platforms are rising and falling in the industry? In pursuing this aim, we'll identify key differences in various game-types' successes, assess the factors that contribute to those successes, and gauge where the market for this form of entertainment is headed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### *What you'll be investigating...*\n",
    "    - Are the sales-rates for games of different platforms changing significantly with time?\n",
    "    - If so, are standard console games' sales faltering in that changing environment?\n",
    "    - Which factors contribute to sales, and can they be modelled to predict sales?\n",
    "    \n",
    "For all this, we'll be using the Python programming language, some data, and data-science concepts. It's ok if you don't have experience with these! You'll be going on a step-by-step walkthrough of a typical data-oriented analysis project. Here, your data will be about the financial successes of the video game industry, and your analysis will evaluate console performance in regards to other forms of gaming. Then, you will:\n",
    "    - collect relevant data on industry performance\n",
    "    - process the data and prepare it for statistical analysis\n",
    "    - perform introductory exploration of the data to determine hypotheses of interest\n",
    "    - test theories, use machine learning to model aspects of the data, and test your models\n",
    "    - yield useful insight from your results, and address the flaws of your experimentation"

The data, in broad terms, covers critical and commercial data regarding all major-brand game  releases, from various developers, and on various platforms. It does so for games from (at the earliest) 1982 up until December of 2016. Further details are explained below. \n",

We navigate to the download option of the above site, and find the exact URL address of the dataset on the Kaggle server. We use that address, and a pandas library function, to read that dataset into a desirable format, and then output a portion of it to see what we have."

    "Our data is messy and extraneous. We'll remove features that don't relate to our analysis. Japanese and EU sales are too niche of a category - let's instead focus on American and global sales, and remove the others. Scores from critics and users may matter, but their counts are removable. Finally, we keep the platform (consoles vs. non-consoles) column, but disregard publishers, developers and maturity ratings (which are better-explained by platform and genre).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll sort the data by year and then by name, in ascending order. After that, we'll peek at the unique platform brands found in the data (printed below), and rename them in a clearer way. Essentially, one re-labelling will be for the portable (Nintendo, Gameboy, and PlayStation) consoles, and another for the non-portable PlayStation and Xbox consoles. PC and Dreamcast are, for now, left as is. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__! PC and Dreamcast are the only atypical gaming types in this set. And Dreamcast is an old system! It can transform into a handheld OR standard console, but is very outdated. Hence, we'll remove entries with Dreamcast games. So PC is our only gauge of non-console gaming. However, per our prior (and other) sources, the conversation regarding consoles' demise is centered around rising PC use, so this is an acceptable feature for our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these categories, we'll create a new column, for the *general* type of a platform. PC refers to non-console gaming, while portable (handheld) and non-portable consoles are the other types. This yields 3 possible values for each entry of this column, based on the platform-brand attribute we just changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing: the two sale types are in terms of units sold (not money value), so we don't account for inflation. But they *were* standardized (made into a mathematically comparable format) via a formula derived by the data provider (see the data-source link for details). We'll have to do something similar for the two types of scores - as we can see (even from Step 1) that they're on different scales. How? As follows:\n",
    "    - Divide all entries in each score column by the column's max. value, making each value  relative to that maximum.\n",
    "    - Why maxima? Well, neither we nor the data provider know the true ranges (out of 5? 10?) used for the scores. \n",
    "    - This way, each critic/user score becomes a value between 0 and 1, relative to the max. *possible* critic/user score. \n",
    "    - And the meaning is unchanged! Higher scores are still better.\n",

    "##### A brief summary:\n",
    "It looks like after rising until 2005, all sales - and hence console sales - are going down! 2005 is also when, seemingly, handheld consoles and non-consoles (many of which are hidden in the plot) began to lessen consoles' dominance of the market. Save for a few outliers, the increasing red and yellow markers show that as sales wind down, more of them are non-standard-consoles. So are consoles fading out? Maybe our regression results can shed some light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard consoles' regression line is hard to discern, but decidedly positive. Visually, consoles have been doing well, and likely will not go 'extinct'. Interestingly, the lines for handheld and non-consoles are negative and nearly 0-sloped, respectively. But as we mentioned, these other formats climbed to popularity recently - so even if sales dip at the time that they take over more of the market, it's unfair to lump them into one boat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our introductory graph already has significant flaws! Also, it doesn't consider other factors that may simultaneously affect sales (ratings, etc.). So, let's take a look at more plots to widen our understanding of these trends.\n",
    "#####     \n",
    "*__Plot 2.__* A simple variable to account for is the game's genre, or type. Games like shooters, are perpetually popular, whereas beloved simulation games are few and far between. Public tastes in genre change over time, but maybe video games aren't in tune with that - and are losing sales because of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be using one key feature that you may want to read up on: a pivot table. Long story short, it's a data structure that can be used, in our case, to make detailed plots. See the following documentation:\n",
    "    - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.pivot_table.html\n",
    "\n",
    "If companies are losing money because of genre, we need to see how genres are shifting over time, as sales shift. We'll again plot sales vs. time - but via a bar plot, where each bar is split into genre-colors. If one year, only shooters were sold, the bar would be all one color; if only two genres were sold, the bar would be two colors, with the more-sold genre-color taking up more space. This way, we can eyeball how changing genres correlate to video game success."

    "##### A brief summary:\n",
    "We see the same inverted parabolic shape of the data over time, but a pattern for *genre* over time isn't immediately seen. A few individual genres do have unique sales-trajectories over time. For instance, action games' portion of each bar grows steadily until 2013, after which it drops. Adventure games, meanwhile, see a general decline up until 2013, after which they make up scarcely any of the sales. Similar observations can be made for all genres. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, however, the plot doesn't support a genre-sales relationship too strongly. For the most part, the proportions for each game type seems constant in each bar. How so? In 2001 (relatively low sales), most colors take up the same proportion of the bar as in 2008 (the highest sales). In both years, action and adventure games (combined) compose nearly half of the sales, fighting and racing game proportions are near-identical, and strategy proportions are negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could visually analyze this chart forever; a follow-up plot could be line graph (try it out!). For instance, if we calculated exact proportions each year, and created a line graph, we could near-exactly test our visual observations about genre changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, however, we will simply perform linear regression on the sales-genre interaction in Step 5. This will give allow us to run statistical tests to mathematically assert the viability of including genre's effect on sales in any model. Now, we move to our final independent variables. "

    "##### A brief summary:\n",
    "This graph is made a little confusing by the great spread for the sales data. However, a clear clustering is visible; the sales are concentrated between 0 and 15 (million units), and seem to grow as critical ur user scores do. Interestingly, one score does not seem to out-influence the other - the highest sales are near identical, with the critical and user scores for it within a very small margin. Let's look at the regression results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales grow with both ratings at positive  but low-magnitude (slow) rates. The line for user score starts out at higher sales values than the critic-score line. However, the critic-line has a stronger slope (marginally), and ends at higher sales values. The simple regression seems weak - even with a 0-1 change in either score, the model only explains a less-than-5 (million unit) change in sales. However, both lines are still worth analyzing formally in our next step. "

We'll calculate residuals, or the difference between actual and predicted values, for each row. We'll plot these residuals against our predictions, and anticipate (ideally) residuals that are near 0, and not distributed in any mathematical pattern. If this is not the case, that means the difference between our predictions and actual values are likely high, and due to some hidden independent feature. Read more about residual plots here:\n",

    "Some weakness with these models included limitations in the dataset, as not every single video game is included in the dataset (even if a strong portion of all major-brand ones were). Furthermore, of the dataset, some data had missing values, which were removed and further reduced the dataset. In addition, the only representation of non-consoles was computer games, while other categories had multiple representations - hence we cannot say we challenged ocnsole sales against all forms of 'modern' gaming. \n",
